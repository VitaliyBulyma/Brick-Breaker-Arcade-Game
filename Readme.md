In one of the JavaScript classes I learned about canvas, and how JavaScript could be used to render something on the page.
I really liked the idea and decided to explore it. I found an amazing tutorial (unfortunately lost the name and the source),
which showed how to create one of the best games of all times - An Arcade Brick Bracker! 

In addition to having a lot of fun playing the game, 
I learned the importance of breaking the code into small functions
that could be re-used multiple times within other functions to create desired effects.
